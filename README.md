#### Required Text: #### 
_Object-Oriented Design Using JAVA_, Dale Skrien,
2009, McGraw-Hill Higher Education. ISBN 978-0-07-2975416-4

#### Course Policies: ####

  * A 90\% - 100\%
  * B 80\% - 89\%
  * C 70\% - 79\%
  * D 60\% - 69\%
  * F Below 60\%
* Percent of Grade:
  * Homework: 20\%
  * Programming Assignments: 50\%
  * Midterm Exam: 10\%
  * Presetation: 10\%
  * Final Exam: 10\%

#### Groups: #### 
The class will be divided into groups. The instructor will
determine group membership. Students will **not** be allowed to change
groups once assigned. All students must participate in the group work.  Besides
the programming assignments, each group will be required to give a presentation
on a topic assigned by the instructor.  All group work will require a feedback
document from each group member on that member`s performance as well as the
performance of the other group members.


__**This is not a game.**__ Working alone is not an option.
Consider the group assignments as part of a job.  Failure to actively HELP your
group will result in a failing grade in this course. That means communicate with
group members, attend planned meetings, complete tasks on time, seek help from
group members when needed. The fact that you may or may not like other group
members is irrelevant. You simply have to get along and get it done
**without** drama. 



#### Homework/programming assignments: #### 

Homework and programming assignments will be posted and managed through
WyoCourses.  Homework will be submitted as typed electronic documents (no
scanned documents allowed). The allowed file formats are PDF (PDF/A compliant),
Word (doc/docx), and OpenDocument (odt).

Each programming assignment will have its format, language, and method of
submission specified in the assignment.  Failure to comply with the assigned
specifications will result in a 0 (zero) grade for the assignment.  

Each homework or programming assignment will have a due date and time assigned.
Any late submission will be assessed a 10% (ten percent) late penalty. It can be
at most 24 hours late. WyoCourses will not accept any submission after that time.

Homework must be done individually. You must NOT copy anyone else's work, that
includes anything you find online. Retyping what you have found and changing a
couple of words is still plagiarism. The use of quotes and citations is not
allowed. Anyone suspected of copying/using someone else's work will be subject
to the University's policies on academic dishonesty, see below.

Programming assignments will be done as group projects. There will be
<u>one</u> copy of the assignment materials submitted for each group.
Scoring rubrics for each programming assignment will be part of the
documentation provided to you.


#### Presentations: #### 

Each group will give a presentation to the class.


* A presentation by each group, during class, will count as one of the
regular lectures. Each presentation will be accompanied by a separate
bibliography that will be submitted to the instructor. Each presentation will be
worth 40 points.

* __Every__ student will be expected to attend __every__ group presentation.
Attendance will be taken by completion of a feedback form on the presentation.
Attendance will be worth 5 points per presentation.



#### Academic Honesty: ####

Assignments are intended to be completed independently unless otherwise
specified by the instructor. UW Regulation 2-114 defines academic dishonesty and
specifies the penalties <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.uwyo.edu/generalcounsel">Office of the General Counsel's</a>
webpage and select **Current Regulations and Presidential Directives** for the
content of all the University regulations)

Collaboration and discussion are acceptable, but you MUST do your own work. The
grade you receive must represent your effort and achievement not that of others.
Anything else is unfair to you and to your fellow students.

#### Attendance: ####

Attendance at the lecture is highly recommended as not all material will come
from the texts (see further UW Regulation 2-108). Attendance of all members of
each group is required for the presentations.


#### Classroom Behavior ####

At all times, treat your presence in the classroom and your enrollment in this
course as you would a job.  Act professionally, arrive on time, pay attention,
complete your work in a timely and professional manner, and treat all deadlines
seriously.  You will be respectful towards your classmates and instructor.
Spirited debate and disagreement are to be expected in any classroom and all
views will be heard fully, but at all times we will behave civilly and with
respect towards one another. Personal attacks, offensive language, name-calling,
and dismissive gestures are not warranted in a learning atmosphere.  As the
instructor, I have the right to dismiss you from the classroom, study sessions,
electronic forums, and other areas where disruptive behavior occurs.

#### Diversity #### 

The University of Wyoming values an educational environment that is diverse,
equitable, and inclusive. The diversity that students and faculty bring to
class, including age, country of origin, culture, disability, economic class,
ethnicity, gender identity, immigration status, linguistic, political
affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, worldview, and
other social and cultural diversity is valued, respected, and considered a
resource for learning.


#### Students with disabilities: ####

If you have a physical, sensory, or psychological disability and require
accommodations, please let me know as soon as possible. You will need to
register with, and possibly provide documentation of your disability to,
Disability Support Services (DSS), room 109 Knight Hall.  You may also contact
DSS at (307) 766-3073 or <a target="_blank"
href="mailto:udss@uwyo.edu">udss@uwyo.edu</a>. Visit their website for more
informaion: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uwyo.edu/udss">

#### Other Information: ####

The use of cell phones, pagers, and other devices that beep, ring, etc. is
prohibited in class. They must be turned off or set to "silent". Text messaging
is extremely distracting to the instructor so please wait until after class to
reply to or check your messages.

WyoCourses will be an integral part of the class.  You are free to customize
your notifications but please check whatever you use regularly.  Course
information **may** be distributed by email and you will be held responsible for
any such information.  It may also be distributed by WyoCourses announcement.  

The course site will maintain the most current copy of this syllabus, the
homework, and programming assignments, and a gradebook. The online gradebook
will only be used to show you the grades for assignments, and exams. The totals
that may be part of the online gradebook are almost never accurate, do not rely
on them for your course grade. I keep the official course grades offline. If you
want to talk about your current standing, see me during office hours.


#### Basic Course Schedule: #### 

The academic calendar that can be accessed from WyoWeb, shows 'important' dates.
The ones that most concern us are:


* January 28, First classe
* March 18-22, Spring Break
* March 27, Midterm Grades due
* May 10, Last day of classes
* May 13, Final Exam, 10:00 AM -- 12:15 PM
* May 18, Commencement



#### Notes: ####


* The exams for this course will be "comprehensive" in that you will be
responsible for all of the course material assigned, discussed, or covered in
any way from the first day of the course up until the start of the exam.  Any
change in the schedule for an exam will be announced at least two (2) class
periods in advance.

* Exam questions will normally be of the short answer or essay type. If you
have any question about what that means in terms how you should answer, please
ask me.  

* Office hours are kept for the benefit of the students. They are intended
to be set times when the instructor is known to be available in his office to
answer questions, discuss course material and provide help. If I will not be
available for office hours, you will be notified as much in advance as possible.
There are times when this may be a sticky note on my door. I am normally here at
the University from 0800 to 1430 Monday through Friday.  I do have other
classes. If you wish to come by outside of scheduled hours, please feel free.  I
will not guarantee that I can talk to you but we can make arrangements for some
other time when I am available. You can also phone or email.

* I do not often read email in the evenings or on weekends.  I do have my
machine on all the time I am in the office and unless I get absorbed in
something, I read and answer my email all day. But, do not plan on an immediate
answer. I will read and answer as fast as I can but there are no guarantees I
even remember what time it is let alone when the last time I checked my email
was.  


#### This Syllabus: ####

This document is subject to change. Any changes will be communicated to the
students in a timely manner. No changes involving grading will affect
assignments already given at the time of the change. No changes in assignment
due dates will affect current assignments if such change causes the assignment
to be due earlier than originally indicated.

*Last Update:* 2/04/2019
