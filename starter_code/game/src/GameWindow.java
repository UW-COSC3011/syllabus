 * This is the actual "game". Will have to make some major changes.
 * This is just a "hollow" shell.
 *
 * When you get done, I should see the buttons at the top in the "play" area
 * (NOT a pull-down menu). The only one that should do anything is Quit.
 *
 * Should also see something that shows where the 4x4 board and the "spare"
 * tiles will be when we get them stuffed in.
 *
 * This COULD be part of a package but I choose to make the starting point NOT a
 * package. However all other added elements can certainly be sub-packages, and
 * probably should be.
